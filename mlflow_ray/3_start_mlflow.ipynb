    "-   an object store, in which MLFlow will log artifacts - model weights, images (e.g. PNGs), and so on. In our deployment, this will be realized by MinIO, an open source object storage system that is compatible with AWS S3 APIs (so it may be used as a drop-in self-managed replacement for AWS S3).\n",
