    "## Track a Lightning experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous experiment, we manually added a lot of MLFlow logging code to our Pytorch training script. However, [for many ML frameworks](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html#supported-libraries), MLFLow can automatically log relevant details. In this section, we will convert our Pytorch training script to a Pytorch Lightning script, for which automatic logging is supported in MLFlow, to see how this capability works.\n",

    "After completing this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   understand what Pytorch Lightning is, and some benefits of using Lightning over “vanilla” Pytorch\n",
