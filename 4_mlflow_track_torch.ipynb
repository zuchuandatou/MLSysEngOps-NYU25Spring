To address this, at the organization level, the ML Platform team at GourmetGram has set up a tracking server that all GourmetGram ML teams can use to track their experiments. Moving forward, your training scripts should log all the relevant details of each training run to MLFlow.\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "import mlflow.pytorch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "MLFlow includes framework-specific modules for many machine learning frameworks, including [Pytorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html), [scikit-learn](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html), [Tensorflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html), [HuggingFace/transformers](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.transformers.html), and many more. In this example, most of the functions we will use come from base `mlflow`, but we will use an `mlflow.pytorch`-specific function to save the Pytorch model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configure MLFlow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main configuration that is required for MLFlow tracking is to tell the MLFlow client where to send everything we are logging! By default, MLFlow assumes that you want to log to a local directory named `mlruns`. Since we want to log to a remote tracking server, you’ll have to override this default.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to specify the location of the tracking server would be with a call to `set_tracking_uri`, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://A.B.C.D:8000/\") \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `A.B.C.D` is the IP address of your tracking server. However, we may prefer not to hard-code the address of the tracking server in our code (for example, because we may occasionally want the same code to log to different tracking servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "In these experiments, we will instead specify the location of the tracking server with the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable, which we have already passed to the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A list of other environment variables that MLFLow uses is available in [its documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.environment_variables.html). )\n",
    "\n",
    "We also set the “experiment”. In MLFlow, an “experiment” is a group of related “runs”, e.g. different attempts to train the same type of model. If we don’t specify any experiment, then MLFlow logs to a “default” experiment; but we will specify that runs of this code should be organized inside the “food11-classifier” experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.set_experiment(\"food11-classifier\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start a run**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In MLFlow, each time we train a model, we start a new run. Before we start training, we call\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.start_run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, we can put all the training inside a\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run():\n",
    "    # ... do stuff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "block. In this example, we actually start a run inside a\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try: \n",
    "    mlflow.end_run() # end pre-existing run, if there was one\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    mlflow.start_run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "block, since we are going to interrupt training runs with Ctrl+C, and without “gracefully” ending the run, we may not be able to start a new run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Track system metrics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when we called `start_run`, we passed a `log_system_metrics=True` argument. This directs MLFlow to automatically start tracking and logging details of the host on which the experiment is running: CPU utilization and memory, GPU utilization and memory, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to automatically log GPU metrics, we must have installed `pyrsmi` (for AMD GPUs) or `pynvml` (for NVIDIA GPUs) - we installed these libraries inside the container image already. (But if we would build a new container image, we’d want to remember that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides for the details that are tracked automatically, we also decided to get the output of `rocm-smi` (for AMD GPUs) or `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs), and save the output as a text file in the tracking server. This type of logged item is called an artifact - unlike some of the other data that we track, which is more structured, an artifact can be any kind of file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.log_text(gpu_info, \"gpu-info.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to save the contents of the `gpu_info` variable as a text file artifact named `gpu-info.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log hyperparameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we will want to save all of the hyperparameters associated with our training run, so that we can go back later and identify optimal values. Since we have already saved all of our hyperparameters as a dictionary at the beginning, we can just call\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.log_params(config)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "passing that entire dictionary. This practice of defining hyperparameters in one place (a dictionary, an external configuration file) rather than hard-coding them throughout the code, is less error-prone but also easier for tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log metrics during training**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the thing we most want to track: the metrics of our model during training! We use `mlflow.log_metrics` inside each training run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.log_metrics(\n",
    "{\"epoch_time\": epoch_time,\n",
    "    \"train_loss\": train_loss,\n",
    "    \"train_accuracy\": train_acc,\n",

    "to log the training and validation metrics per epoch. We also track the time per epoch (because we may want to compare runs on different hardware or different distributed training strategies) and the number of trainable parameters (so that we can sanity-check our fine tuning strategy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log model checkpoints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second part of our fine-tuning, when we un-freeze the backbone/base layer, we log the same metrics. In this training loop, though, we additionally log a model checkpoint at the end of each epoch if the validation loss has improved:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.pytorch.log_model(food11_model, \"food11\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model *and* many details about it will be saved as an artifact in MLFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log test metrics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the training run, we also log the evaluation on the test set:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "mlflow.log_metrics(\n",
    "    {\"test_loss\": test_loss,\n",
